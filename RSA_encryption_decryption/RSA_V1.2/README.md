RSA algoritm implemetation in Python for encryption and decryption of text data.


## Prerequisites 
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Installation and usage

  python3 rsa_v1.2.py
  ```

    
## Working

- It is a menu driven program.

- it provides three options which are key generation, Encryption and Decryption.

- For Encryption you have to provide text to be Encrypted, key and N.

- For Decryption also you have to provide cipher, key and N.
